## 📌 What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes code using **objects and classes**. It helps make code **modular, reusable, and easier to maintain**.

OOP in Python revolves around 4 major principles:

1. **Encapsulation** – Hiding internal data and showing only necessary parts
2. **Inheritance** – Reusing and extending existing classes
3. **Polymorphism** – Using the same method in different ways
4. **Abstraction** – Hiding complex logic and showing only relevant features
